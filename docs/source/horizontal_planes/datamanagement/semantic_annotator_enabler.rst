ASSIST-IoT Semantic Annotation Enabler Repository Enabler.



introduction
============

This enabler offers a service of syntactic transformation of JSON, CSV
and XML data formats into RML, also known as semantic lifting, or
semantic annotation.

Two methods of annotation are supported: one-time through a REST API,
and message-based through a persistent stream.

Annotations are configured using the `RML <https://rml.io/specs/rml/>`__
format.

In the first release, the REST API, with (optional) helper web GUI is
supported, as well as tentative streaming infrastructure on Apache
Flink. Final version will include a streaming processor for Kafka/MQTT
with persistent annotation channels.
