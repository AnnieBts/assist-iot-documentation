Introduction
************
The ASSIST-IoT fall arrest device is an emergency device. It is a localisation tag with a fall arrest sensor interface, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a push button. The push button is used by the person wearing the tag, to indicate that this person is in an emergency situation and needs immediate help. The fall arrest device has a fall arrest detector interface which is used to connect the fall arrest sensor. This sensor detects a deployed fall-arrest system, indicating a person being suspended, and jointly with the IMU, the device determines if the person has fallen or not. If an emergency situation is detected, a message is trans-mitted to the anchors immediately. An enabler can pick up this message and act accordingly.
